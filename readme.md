## Postify |

A mock social media platform - simple CRUD app for a user to create, read, update, and delete posts.

This is a DevMountain Foundations Capstone project. Over the past 7 weeks, we've learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node. I challenged myself to learn new things during this capstone, notably React and nestjs.

Imports users from database to populate generated "Who to follow" cards.
